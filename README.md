# ServerDown Beta
<div>
	ServerDown is a program to take down weak servers and home servers
	<br>
	Currently with only 1 person working on it
	<br>
	Developed in Python and C#
	<br>
	With only a super light executable
	<br>
	Currently in version 0.5
	<br>
	<b style="color:red">Attention!!</b> when launching a new version the <a href="http://bit.do/SvDnRef">website</a> will be updated first
</div>


## Installation
<div>
	Just run <code>ServerDown0.5.exe</code> file
	<br>
	<strong>Remember that the application only runs on Windows</strong>
</div>


## How to use
<div>
	1. Download the program.
	<br>
	2. Execute the program.
	<br>
	3. Type the website or ip you want and press Enter.
	<b>
		<br>
		Remember that it has to be a website that is hosted on a weak server
		<br>
		Remember that it may not work 100% of the time
	</b>
</div>


## How does it work
<div>
	ServerDown uses a public proxy network
	<br>
	which makes several connections of different types on the chosen server
</div>
